### About me

ðŸ’¡ I am a scientist and engineer, passionate about AI & sustainability. I created [Entalpic](https://entalpic.ai) with the amazing Mathieu Galtier (CEO) and Alexandre Duval (CSO) in 2024. Entalpic is an AI-driven discovery company for chemistry and material science, fostering greener and smarter industrial processes. We're proud to build this company together with a team of smart, talented and caring people.

I love to cook (I'm a fan of Ottolenghi's cookbooks), hike up (downhill sucks) and play tennis. I enjoy talking about everything, from politics (I heard it's a French thing) and philosophy to prime numbers (did you know any prime squared is just 1 more than a [multiple of 24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMkIiFs35HQ)?)


### TL;DR Resume

I conducted my PhD 2019â†’2024 with Yoshua Bengio at Mila & UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al on *Deep Learning Applications to Climate Change Mitigation*. Prior to this PhD, I was a student at Ã‰cole polytechnique, France (Engineering degree - 2012â†’2016), and at University College London, UK (MSc. in Machine Learning - 2016â†’2017). I also worked for about a year as a [Public Interest Entrepreneur](https://eig.etalab.gouv.fr/) at the [French Ministry for the Econommy and Finance](https://eig.etalab.gouv.fr/defis/hopkins/) (2018).

### Open source

I also love creating open-source libraries. I tend to be the kind of persons who will spend a week or a month automating something that takes a couple hours, and then make an open-source project out ouf it. This is how I came to build [PaperMemory](https://github.com/vict0rsch/PaperMemory) a web-based automated reference manager, [`minydra`](https://github.com/vict0rsch/minydra) a minimalist Python argument parser, [`ntfy-wrapper`](https://github.com/vict0rsch/ntfy-wrapper) a simple notification wrapper around the ntfy.sh service, or [`gitmopy`](https://github.com/vict0rsch/gitmopy) an interactive CLI to make pretty commits following the [Gitmoji specification](https://gitmoji.dev/specification).

In 2020, I co-founded [`codecarbon`](https://github.com/mlco2/codedcarbon), an open-source library dedicated to estimated the carbon emissions of your code. After leading it through [Data For Good France](https://dataforgood.fr/projects/codecarbon/)'s 9th season, I stepped back to be able to focus on my PhD studies. I am now part of the NGO's board.

In a previous life, I also created [metada.org](https://metada.org/), a website to visualize the hierarchies of ownership in the French media.
